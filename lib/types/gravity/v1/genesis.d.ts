/**
 * The slashing fractions for the various gravity related slashing conditions. The first three
 * refer to not submitting a particular message, the third for submitting a different claim
 * for the same Ethereum event
 *
 * unbond_slashing_valsets_window
 *
 * The unbond slashing valsets window is used to determine how many blocks after starting to unbond
 * a validator needs to continue signing blocks. The goal of this paramater is that when a validator leaves
 * the set, if their leaving creates enough change in the validator set to justify an update they will sign
 * a validator set update for the Ethereum bridge that does not include themselves. Allowing us to remove them
 * from the Ethereum bridge and replace them with the new set gracefully.
 *
 * valset_reward
 *
 * These parameters allow for the bridge oracle to resolve a fork on the Ethereum chain without halting
 * the chain. Once set reset bridge state will roll back events to the nonce provided in reset_bridge_nonce
 * if and only if those events have not yet been observed (executed on the Cosmos chain). This allows for easy
 * handling of cases where for example an Ethereum hardfork has occured and more than 1/3 of the vlaidtor set
 * disagrees with the rest. Normally this would require a chain halt, manual genesis editing and restar to resolve
 * with this feature a governance proposal can be used instead
 *
 * bridge_active
 *
 * This boolean flag can be used by governance to temporarily halt the bridge due to a vulnerability or other issue
 * In this context halting the bridge means prevent the execution of any oracle events from Ethereum and preventing
 * the creation of new batches that may be relayed to Ethereum.
 * This does not prevent the creation of validator sets
 * or slashing for not submitting validator set signatures as either of these might allow key signers to leave the validator
 * set and steal funds on Ethereum without consequence.
 * The practical outcome of this flag being set to 'false' is that deposits from Ethereum will not show up and withdraws from
 * Cosmos will not execute on Ethereum.
 *
 * min_chain_fee_basis_points
 *
 * The minimum SendToEth `chain_fee` amount, in terms of basis points. e.g. 10% fee = 1000, and 0.02% fee = 2
